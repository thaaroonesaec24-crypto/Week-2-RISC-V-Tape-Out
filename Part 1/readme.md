##  What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?

A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** is an integrated circuit that combines all major components of a computer or electronic system into a single chip.

Unlike traditional systems ‚Äî where the processor, memory, and peripherals exist as separate ICs ‚Äî an SoC integrates them together, leading to:

*  **High performance**
*  **Low power consumption**
*  **Reduced cost and size**

SoCs power everything from **smartphones** and **IoT devices** to **automotive systems** and **AI accelerators**.

##  Components of a Typical SoC

A well-designed SoC harmonizes **computation**, **memory**, **communication**, and **I/O interaction**.

###  Central Processing Unit (CPU)

* **Role:** Executes instructions and controls data flow between components.
* **Types:**

  * *Microcontroller cores*: ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V RV32
  * *Application cores*: ARM Cortex-A, RISC-V RV64
  * *Heterogeneous SoCs*: mix of performance + efficiency cores
* **Design trade-offs:** clock speed, ISA, power, and pipeline depth.
